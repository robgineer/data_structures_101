    "# Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "We finally got to one of the most used data structures for large data: the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is basically a tree, but with less restrictions. Recalling the structure of a binary tree, where each node can have up to two nodes (one left, one right), a graph does not follow this limitation. The amount of nodes and their connections can vary. There is also no root node as the graph is not hierarchical.\n",
    "What we have instead is a loose structure that contains `nodes` and `edges` (representing the connections between nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      D\n",
    "    /\n",
    "   B -- C\n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "      A   G\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in trees, where we are mostly focused on the `nodes`, in graphs we add more meaning to the `edges`. Example: let's model a road network between cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "San Francisco\n",
    "    |        \\\n",
    "    |         Las Vegas --- New York\n",
    "Los Angeles                /    |\n",
    "                    Atlanta     |\n",
    "                              Miami\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That looks like a very simplified road map, right?! True! And its intended to be like that. A graph represents an abstract model of relashionships between different entities. This enables to reduce the overall problem complexity and focus on the actual task. For the road graph we are usually interested in the \"shortest\" or \"most beneficial\" path between two different cities. Adding \"weights\" to the `edges` enables exactly that. These weights could represent the distance, the overall effort required to travel between nodes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, enough theory, let's implement a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the tree, we will create `Node` class that would hold a value and references to connected nodes. Since a node could have more than just two connections in a graph, however, we would use a list representing the references.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we would create bi-directional connections similar to a doubly linked list (making this graph undirected)."
